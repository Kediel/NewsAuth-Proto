== Description ==

A plugin to commit post content to a verifiable datastructure. This plugin takes a copy of post content on every status transition and includes it in verifiable log-based map datastructure. This datastructure can be used for auditing of the consistency of posts and to provide cryptographically verifiable proofs of inclusion, noninclusion and freshness.
